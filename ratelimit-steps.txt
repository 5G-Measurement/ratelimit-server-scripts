Steps:

1- Go to Azure portal: Make virtual machine

2- In networking, add firewall rule for 5201 and modify for 443

3- SSH to the machine

4- Setup the server
    sudo yum install -y git && git clone https://github.com/m-lab/ndt-server.git && git clone https://github.com/ahmadhassan997/rawtcp-udp.git && git clone https://github.com/5G-Measurement/ratelimit-server-scripts.git && cd ratelimit-server-scripts && bash ratelimit-server-setup.sh

5- Do a complete set of tests using run commands

    ## iperf3.9 commands
        ./run-iperf-server.sh [ port number ] # 5201 by default

    ## faketcp commands
        cd rawtcp-udp

        # server command
        ./faketcp-server.sh
        -- type ctrl+c to terminate

        # client command
        cd /data/local/tmp # if not already in that directory
        sudo ./faketcp-client.sh [SERVERNAME]
        -- type ctrl+c to terminate

    ## ndt commands
        
        # server command
        ./run-ndt-server.sh

        # client ip address
        http://[IP]/ndt7.html

6- Go to Azure portal again: delete the virtual machine

## Things to remember
    # Make sure no processes are running after you complete a test

    -- To check ports that are listening for connections
        sudo lsof -i -P -n | grep LISTEN

    -- To kill a running process
        kill -9 [PID] # to kill the running process

    -- To check the detached screens sessions
        screen -ls

    -- To attach to a detached screen
        screen -r [screen-name]
